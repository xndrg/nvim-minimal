# Neovim Minimalistic Config
Super simple and actually usable neovim config for my needs

# Requirements
- [luals](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) available in your `$PATH`
- [typescript-language-server](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server) available in your `$PATH`
- [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) package manager installed just in case (But it should work even without it installed)

# Quickstart
Simply move all the files into your nvim config directory.\
Maybe later I'll create some simple script to do everything for you.
